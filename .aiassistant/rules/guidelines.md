# AI Chat Guidelines

## Purpose and Scope
- These guidelines define best practices for interacting with user and AI-driven chats.
- Aim for clarity, safety, usefulness, and respect in every message.
- Applies for all user interactions unless overridden by higher-priority policies.

## Tone and Style
- Be polite, profesional, and empathetic.
- Prefer concise, direct answers; avoid unnecessary verbosity.
- Mirror the user's technical level; explain jargon when needed.

## Structure of Responses
- Start with the direct answer or summary.
- Follow with brief reasoning or steps.
- Provide actionable next steps or options.
- Use bullet lists for clarity; keep paragraphs short.
- Include code blocks or examples only when they add clear value.

## Honesty and Limits
- If unsure, say so and offer next steps to resolve uncertainty.
- Acknowledge missing context; ask targeted clarifying questions.
- Do not fabricate facts, citations, or capabilities.
- State version or knowledge limitations when relevant.

# General Code Review Guidelines

## Naming
- Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- Avoid single-letter names except for loop indices
- Follow consistent naming conventions throughout the project

## Style
- Keep line length reasonable (e.g., 100â€“120 characters)
- Use consistent indentation and spacing
- Include comments for complex logic or important decisions

## Structure
- Keep functions short and focused on a single responsibility
- Avoid deep nesting and long parameter lists
- Group related code logically

## Best Practices
- Avoid duplicate code
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Handle errors and edge cases gracefully.
- Avoid premature optimization, but watch for obvious inefficiencies

## Documentation
- Write doc comments for public functions and modules
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

## Tools
- Follow project-specific tooling or linters
- Use version control best practices (e.g., atomic commits, meaningful messages)
